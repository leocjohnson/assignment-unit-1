        <p>Let’s say that you are going to try to hide in your room. The ‘Secret Room’ that you used to hide in, in the ‘Old’ world. The fact that you are going to retreat here has already been ‘decided’. Because it is ‘destiny’! ‘Destiny’ is brought on by certainty, not by chance! After a full revolution of time, a ‘New World’ appeared! Destiny will repeat itself! When a human meets another human, it is due to ‘gravity’! It happens because it was fated to be that way! And now, humanity has experienced the future, and has now arrived at this world! For example, 5 years from now, what could happen? Everyone knows what will happen, now. During the ‘Accelerated Time’, they experienced when every accident, every illness, when their life would end... They already experienced it before arriving here. What kind of child will one bear, and what kind of person will that child become? Who will one love, and hate? When will war occur, and when will the world change? When will one meet another... and when will they separate? Who will commit crimes and who will invent, create works of beauty? The spirit, not the mind or body, has already experienced and memorized those facts! And that is ‘Happiness’! Not just for one person, but everyone will be able to face their ‘destiny’! Ones who are able to ‘face’ this are the ones who will be ‘happy’! You might think that knowing the ill fortunes of the future is ‘despair’, but... It’s the opposite! Even if you knew you were going to die tomorrow, it is that ‘Resolution’ that makes one happy! Humanity will change! This is what I strived for! This is Made in Heaven! -Enrico Pucci</p>
